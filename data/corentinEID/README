Hi Mike, 
Attached the data I'm using and the script I used to compute the model
- byHouse: big dataset with a lot of informations for all houses mapped
- byManz: smaller dataset similar to byHouse but at the level of the city block
- commonVig: smaller dataset with information only on results of surveillance reports/inspections/spray with informations specific to surveillance, at the level of households
- rocvig: focussing on the results of spray in surveillance

The script should allow you to see what is what.

Hope that helps,

Corentin
